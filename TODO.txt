1. generalized variant of cloneTree:
    ShadowTreeCloner
    updateYogaChildren
    PR: https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/pull/3369/files

2. why is cloning ShadowNodes so slow?
    for first frame and some frames it's even 8x times slower than usually
    getAncestors (traversing children list for each level)
    cloneProps
    updateYogaChildren

3. optimize number of updates applied in ReanimatedCommitHook
    problem: each prop update for each animated component from t=0 must be kept in PropsRegistry
    idea: synchronize prop updates back to JS when React-Fabric clones ShadowNodes
    demo: WidthExample
    problem: works only in specific cases, works when children are updated but not when parents etc. are
    next: synchronize or copy PropsRegistry for reading

4. why is layout calculated before commit hooks?
    asked on discord

5. RNScreens state updates
    still not working properly in WidthExample or ChessboardExample
    fixed by wrapping in <View style={{ flex: 1 }} collapsable={false}>...</View>
